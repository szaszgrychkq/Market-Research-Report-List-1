<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Tags Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID tags are categorized into two main types: active and passive. Active RFID tags have a built-in power source, allowing them to transmit signals over longer distances and store more data, making them ideal for tracking high-value assets or real-time monitoring. Conversely, passive RFID tags do not have an internal power source; they generate power from the RFID readerâ€™s signal, making them cost-effective for applications like inventory management and access control. Each type serves distinct market needs based on functionality and cost.</p></p>
