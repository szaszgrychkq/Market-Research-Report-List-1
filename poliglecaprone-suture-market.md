<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poliglecaprone Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dyed</li><li>Undyed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The poliglecaprone suture market comprises two main types: dyed and undyed sutures. Dyed sutures are colored, enhancing visibility during surgical procedures, which can aid in precise placements and visibility for the surgeon. Undyed sutures, on the other hand, are neutral in color, making them less noticeable in the tissue, which may be preferred in cosmetic surgeries or areas where aesthetic outcomes are a priority. Both types offer unique advantages, catering to different surgical needs and preferences.</p></p>
